# Events

The goal of this workshop is to create and deploy a web application from scratch,
using Go and Google App Engine.

The application is an event manager with weather information for each event. Cool, right?
It doesn't look amazing, but hey ... I'm *really* not a frontend engineer. ðŸ˜…

The implementation will be done in six steps starting, obviously, with step 0.

- [Step 0: basic architecture](step0/README.md)
- [Step 1: JSON and local storage](step1/README.md)
- [Step 2: durable storage](step2/README.md)
- [Step 3: adding weather with openweathermap.org](step3/README.md)
- [Step 4: storing temporary results in Memcache](step4/README.md)
- [Step 5: final version of the application](step5/README.md)

Everything you need to do corresponds to a comment in the code, so don't miss any!
